        What began as a shared dream between two friends, <b>Ashok</b> and
        <b>Guna</b>, has grown into a heartfelt mission to bring hope, help, and
        happiness to those in need. Our journey started with small acts of
        kindness, driven by a deep desire to make a positive difference in our
        community.<br><br> Today, through HFHL Trust, we continue to work together to
        provide food, education, and support to the underprivileged, believing
        that even the smallest step can create a big impact. Our story wouldn’t
        be complete without the unwavering encouragement and active
        participation of our friends, family members, relatives, and many
        kind-hearted well-wishers. Their support has been the backbone of our
        growth, turning our small vision into a larger movement of compassion
        and care.<br><br> Above all, we believe it is by the grace of God that we are
        able to do all these things. Every step forward, every smile we bring,
        and every life we touch is a blessing, and we remain grateful to God for
        guiding our path and giving us the strength to serve.

        How Our Monthly Contribution Works (₹199) HFHL Trust is built on simple,
        steady support.<br><br> Each month, our friends, family members, relatives, and
        well-wishers contribute ₹199 as trust members. This small, consistent
        amount—multiplied across many caring people—creates a reliable fund we
        can plan with every month.<br><br> How We Decide and Use the Funds<br><br>1️⃣ Collect &
        Record: We collect the monthly ₹199 contributions and record every entry
        for transparency.<br><br>2️⃣ Plan Together: At the start of each month, our core
        team (founded by Ashok and Guna) reviews needs and suggestions from
        members.<br><br>3️⃣ Allocate Wisely: We set a simple plan for that month,
        prioritizing urgent and high-impact activities.<br><br>4️⃣ Execute & Report: We
        carry out the plan with volunteers/partners, then share updates, photos,
        and a short impact summary.<br><br> Where Your ₹199 Goes<br><br> ✔️Food Donation: Cooked
        meals and grocery kits for the homeless, elderly, and low-income
        families.<br><br> ✔️Educational Assistance: School supplies, fees support in
        special cases, mentorship sessions, and small learning grants.<br><br>
        ✔️Healthcare Support: Basic medical camps, essential medicines in urgent
        cases, and connections to affordable care.<br><br> ✔️Social Welfare & Relief:
        Seasonal drives (blankets, sanitary kits), emergency relief, and
        community development activities.<br><br>
